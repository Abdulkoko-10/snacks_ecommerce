### Proposed Additions/Modifications for MANUAL_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md

**Option 1: Add as a new dedicated section at the beginning of "User Interface & Experience (UI/UX)"**

```markdown
### Re-testing Sign-In Functionality (High Priority)

*   **[ ] Navbar - "Sign In" Button (from Ellipsis/Theme Menu):**
    *   [ ] Locate and click the "Sign In" option within the Navbar's ellipsis or theme dropdown menu.
    *   [ ] **Expected:** Clerk.js sign-in modal appears promptly.
    *   [ ] **Clerk Modal Theming:** Verify the modal's styling (background, text colors, input fields, buttons) is consistent with the site theme, reflecting the `clerkAppearance` settings from `pages/_app.js`.
    *   [ ] **Sign-In Flow:** Complete the sign-in process using valid test user credentials.
    *   [ ] **Post Sign-In (Navbar):**
        *   [ ] Verify the "Sign In" option in the menu is replaced by user-specific options or a `UserButton`.
        *   [ ] If `UserButton` is present, verify it displays correctly and is functional.
*   **[ ] Cart - "Sign In to Pre-order" Button:**
    *   [ ] Add at least one item to the cart to make the cart relevant.
    *   [ ] Open the cart.
    *   [ ] Verify the "Sign In to Pre-order" button is visible.
    *   [ ] Click the "Sign In to Pre-order" button.
    *   [ ] **Expected:** Clerk.js sign-in modal appears promptly.
    *   [ ] **Clerk Modal Theming:** (If not already checked above, or re-verify) Verify the modal's styling is consistent with the site theme.
    *   [ ] **Sign-In Flow:** Complete the sign-in process (if not already signed in from the navbar test). If already signed in, this button might change to "Pre-order Now" immediately or after a page refresh/cart update. Note this behavior.
    *   [ ] **Post Sign-In (Cart):**
        *   [ ] Verify the "Sign In to Pre-order" button changes to "Pre-order Now".
        *   [ ] Verify the user's session is recognized (e.g., user information is available to the `handlePreOrder` function, though this is harder to see directly without dev tools).
*   **[ ] General Post Sign-In State:**
    *   [ ] Navigate to different pages and refresh the page.
    *   [ ] **Expected:** User remains signed in. Navbar shows authenticated state (e.g., `UserButton`). Cart continues to show "Pre-order Now" if items are present.
*   **[ ] Sign-Out Flow (if testing sign-in again):**
    *   [ ] If a `UserButton` or sign-out option is available, test the sign-out flow.
    *   [ ] **Expected:** User is signed out. Navbar reverts to "Sign In" state. Cart reverts to "Sign In to Pre-order" button.

```

**Option 2: Integrate into existing checklist sections**

1.  **Under "User Interface & Experience (UI/UX)" -> "Cart - Not Signed In":**
    *   Modify/Add:
        *   `[ ] Verify "Sign In to Pre-order" button is visible.`
        *   `[ ] Click button: Clerk.js sign-in modal should appear **promptly**.`
        *   `[ ] Clerk modal: Test sign-in and sign-up flows.`
        *   `[ ] **Clerk Modal Theming:** Verify the modal's styling (background, text colors, input fields, buttons) is consistent with the site theme, reflecting the `clerkAppearance` settings from `pages/_app.js`.`

2.  **Under "User Interface & Experience (UI/UX)" -> "Cart - Signed In":**
    *   Add/Modify:
        *   `[ ] After successful sign-in (either via Navbar or Cart button), verify "Sign In to Pre-order" button changes to "Pre-order Now".`

3.  **Consider adding a new subsection under "User Interface & Experience (UI/UX)" for Navbar specific tests if it doesn't exist:**
    ```markdown
    *   **[ ] Navbar - User Authentication:**
        *   [ ] **Not Signed In:** Locate and click the "Sign In" option within the Navbar's ellipsis or theme dropdown menu.
        *   [ ] **Expected:** Clerk.js sign-in modal appears promptly.
        *   [ ] **Clerk Modal Theming (Navbar initiated):** Verify modal styling consistency.
        *   [ ] Complete sign-in flow.
        *   [ ] **Post Sign-In (Navbar):** Verify "Sign In" option updates to `UserButton` or authenticated state.
    ```

These proposed changes ensure that the previously problematic sign-in scenarios are explicitly re-tested with a focus on modal appearance, theming, and correct state transitions after authentication.The proposed changes for `MANUAL_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md` have been created in `PROPOSED_CHECKLIST_CHANGES.md`.
This focuses on re-testing the sign-in buttons in the Cart and Navbar, verifying the Clerk modal opens, is themed correctly, and that user state updates appropriately after sign-in.

This completes the subtask.
