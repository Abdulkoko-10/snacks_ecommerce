# Project Overview: Food Discovery Platform Revamp

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the strategic vision and goals for the revamp of the Food Discovery Platform. The project's primary objective is to evolve the existing single-source e-commerce application into a sophisticated, multi-provider food discovery and recommendation engine.

## 2. Current State

The platform currently operates as a standard e-commerce website, featuring products managed directly within a dedicated Sanity.io CMS. It includes essential features like user authentication (Clerk), payments (Stripe), and a product catalog.

## 3. Strategic Vision

The vision for the revamp is to transform the platform into a comprehensive aggregator. Key strategic goals include:

- **Integration with Multiple Food Providers:** Connect to external APIs (e.g., UberEats, DoorDash) to ingest and display a wide variety of food options.
- **Unified User Experience:** Present aggregated data through a single, seamless interface, with a canonical representation for each food item.
- **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Leverage Gemini AI to provide personalized recommendations, intelligent search, and a conversational chat interface.
- **Enhanced Content and Community:** Allow users to contribute native comments and reviews, enriching the platform's data.

## 4. Desired Outcome

Upon completion, the platform will no longer be just a store, but a powerful discovery tool that helps users find the best food options from various providers, tailored to their preferences, with intelligent assistance at every step.
