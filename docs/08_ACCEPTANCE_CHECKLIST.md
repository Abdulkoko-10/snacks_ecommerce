# MVP Acceptance Checklist

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the acceptance checklist for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) release. The product should not be considered ready to ship until all of the following criteria are met and verified.

## 2. Feature Checklist

-   **[ ] Search & Discovery:**
    -   The `GET /search` endpoint successfully returns normalized products from the persistent database.
    -   Results include clear source attribution (e.g., "from UberEats").

-   **[ ] Product Details:**
    -   Product pages correctly display all data from the `CanonicalProduct` schema.
    -   The comments section displays comments from all origins (`external` and `food-discovery`) with clear labels.
    -   The "FoodDiscovery comments only" toggle correctly filters the comments list.

-   **[ ] Chat & Recommendations:**
    -   The `ChatPage` is functional and can send/receive messages.
    -   The chat interface can successfully return inline recommendation cards (`ChatRecommendationCard`) under the relevant user message.

    -   The Gemini-based recommendation pipeline successfully produces top-K suggestions with human-readable reason strings.

-   **[ ] Floating Cat Assistant:**
    -   The floating cat element is present across all pages.
    -   Clicking the cat successfully opens the chat interface.

-   **[ ] Security:**
    -   All provider tokens, API keys, and other secrets are stored securely in the chosen secrets manager (e.g., Vault, Doppler).

    -   Critical integration tests (e.g., frontend â†” orchestrator) are passing.
    -   Contract tests for the primary API endpoints are passing.
    -   Unit tests for key business logic (e.g., canonicalization) meet coverage requirements.
