# Project Progress Tracker

This document tracks the progress of the Food Discovery Platform revamp. It is designed to be a living document, updated by the development team and AI agents.

## **Current Focus: Blocked by Build Failure**

**Status:** `[BLOCKED]`

- **Goal:** Implement the new microservices architecture with a full data enrichment pipeline.
- **Current State:** The full implementation is complete, but the application build is failing on Vercel.
- **Next Step:** The immediate priority is to resolve the build failure before proceeding with any new features.

---

## **Known Issues / Blockers**

- **`[BLOCKER]` Persistent Build Failure:**
    - **Error:** `error TS2345: Argument of type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.`
    - **Location:** `orchestrator/src/lib/mongodb.ts`
    - **Description:** The build is failing because the `MongoClient.connect` function is being called with `process.env.MONGODB_URI`, which TypeScript correctly identifies as potentially being `undefined`. This violates strict type checking.
    - **Resolution:** A null check must be added before the `MongoClient.connect` call to satisfy the TypeScript compiler.

## Phase -1: Documentation & Planning

**Status:** `[DONE]`

- `[DONE]` Analyze existing codebase
- `[DONE]` Create comprehensive architecture & planning documents

---

## Phase 0: Preparatory Work

**Status:** `[IN PROGRESS]`

- `[DONE]` Scaffold new service directories (`orchestrator`, `connectors`).
- `[DONE]` Set up shared schemas package (`@fd/schemas`).
- `[DONE]` Set up secrets management in Vercel.
- `[IN PROGRESS]` Configure CI/CD for new services. *(Note: Build scripts for monorepo are in place but are currently failing).*

## Phase 1: Unified Schema & First Connector

**Status:** `[IN PROGRESS]`
**Depends on:** Phase 0

1.  **Core Implementation:**
    - `[IN PROGRESS]` Build Canonicalizer Service & Persistent DB (MongoDB). *(Note: Connection logic is implemented but is the source of the current build failure).*
    - `[DONE]` Build first provider connector (`geoapify-connector`).
    - `[DONE]` Build enrichment connector (`serpapi-connector`).
    - `[IN PROGRESS]` Implement core orchestrator endpoints (`/search`) with caching and enrichment. *(Note: Logic is implemented but blocked by build failure).*
    - `[TODO]` Migrate existing Sanity data.
    - `[TODO]` Adapt frontend to use new API.
2.  **QA & Testing:**
    - `[TODO]` Unit tests for connector logic.
    - `[TODO]` Integration tests for connectors.
    - `[TODO]` Contract tests between frontend and orchestrator.
3.  **Integration Points Checklist:**
    - `[ ]` Does the orchestrator handle the unified schema correctly?
    - `[ ]` Is the orchestrator calling the connectors correctly?
    - `[ ]` Is data being persisted and cached in MongoDB?

## Phase 2: Chat Page & Recommendations

**Status:** `[IN PROGRESS]`
**Depends on:** Phase 1

1.  **Core Implementation:**
    - `[DONE]` Build Chat UI Components.
    - `[TODO]` Implement real-time (WebSocket/streaming) connection.
    - `[IN PROGRESS]` Implement end-to-end chat flow. *(Note: Logic is implemented in the orchestrator but is blocked by the build failure).*
    - `[DONE]` UI Polish: Refined recommendation card design and implemented full-bleed carousel.
    - `[IN PROGRESS]` Integrate with Gemini for recommendations. *(Note: Logic is implemented but blocked by the build failure).*
    - `[TODO]` Polish and bugfix chat UI.
2.  **QA & Testing:*
    - `[TODO]` Unit tests for Chat UI components.
    - `[TODO]` E2E tests for the chat flow.
3.  **Integration Points Checklist:**
    - `[ ]` Does the Gemini API fully integrate here for basic responses?
    - `[ ]` Re-implement real-time connection for chat.
    - `[ ]` Does the frontend correctly render `ChatRecommendationPayload`?

## Phase 3: Personalization & Advanced Recommendations

**Status:** `[TODO]`
**Depends on:** Phase 1 & Phase 2

1.  **Core Implementation:**
    - `[TODO]` Implement embedding pipeline
    - `[TODO]` Develop user intent modeling
    - `[TODO]` Enhance recommendation logic with embeddings and scoring
    - `[TODO]` Implement "reasons" generation
2.  **QA & Testing:**
    - `[TODO]` Unit tests for embedding generation.
    - `[TODO]` Integration tests for vector DB similarity lookups.
    - `[TODO]` E2E tests for personalized recommendation flow.
3.  **Integration Points Checklist:**
    - `[ ]` Are embeddings being generated and stored correctly?
    - `[ ]` Does the orchestrator use embeddings for candidate selection?
    - `[ ]` Does the Gemini "reasons" generation work as expected?

---

## Phase 4: Native Comments & Content Merging

**Status:** `[TODO]`
**Depends on:** Phase 1

1.  **Core Implementation:**
    - `[TODO]` Implement native comments API
    - `[TODO]` Update frontend to display unified comments
    - `[TODO]` Refine data merging logic
2.  **QA & Testing:**
    - `[TODO]` Unit tests for the comments API.
    - `[TODO]` Frontend tests for the unified comments display.
3.  **Integration Points Checklist:**
    - `[ ]` Does the orchestrator correctly merge comments from different sources?
    - `[ ]` Is the frontend displaying the unified comment list correctly?

---

## Phase 5: Reliability, Scaling & Observability

**Status:** `[TODO]`
**Depends on:** All previous phases

1.  **Core Implementation:**
    - `[TODO]` Implement circuit breakers, rate limiting, etc.
    - `[TODO]` Set up monitoring, logging, and tracing
2.  **QA & Testing:**
    - `[TODO]` Implement comprehensive testing (unit, integration, contract, E2E) across all services.
    - `[TODO]` Set up synthetic monitoring for critical user flows.
